# Hello There! :wave:
My name is Akshaj, which means a "thunderbolt", "diamond", and is also one of the numerous monikers given to Lord Vishnu. Since my childhood, I've been fascinated by superheroes and star wars. As a result, I aspire to be an astronomer. 

To prepare for my dream career as an astronomer, I'm honing my skills in maths, science, user research, design, programming, data science, and artificial intelligence through a variety of projects and internships.

I believe those user research, programming and data science skills will help in my career to acquire, store, and process huge amount of unstructured space data and my Design, AI and story telling skills will help me to find the pattern and predict and visualize insights through data story telling skills.
